# stock_predictor.py

This project predicts the stock price of a company using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). LSTM is particularly well-suited for time-series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, such as stock prices.

---

## Features
- Predicts future stock prices using historical data.
- Implements an LSTM model built with Keras/TensorFlow.
- Handles preprocessing of stock price data.
- Plots actual vs predicted prices for visualization.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock_predictor.git
   cd stock_predictor
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

To run the predictor, use the following command:

```bash
python stock_predictor.py
```

Make sure you have the required dataset (e.g., CSV of historical stock prices) available or modify the script to download data from a source like Yahoo Finance.

---

## Data

The model is designed to work with time-series data such as daily stock prices. You can use any dataset that includes at least the "Date" and "Close" columns.

---

## Output

- The model outputs predicted stock prices.
- A plot will be generated comparing actual and predicted values.

---

## Model Details

- Model Type: LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Layers: Input â†’ LSTM â†’ Dense
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam
