# stock_predictor.py
This project predicts the stock price of a company using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). LSTM is particularly well-suited for time-series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, such as stock prices.
